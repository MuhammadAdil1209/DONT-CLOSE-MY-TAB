# DON'T CLOSE MY TAB Extension - Installation & Testing Guide

## Installation

Since I haven't published this in Chrome Web Store, you will have to manually install it:

1. Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions/`
2. Enable "Developer mode" (toggle in top-right corner)
3. Click "Load unpacked"
4. Select this repo folder after cloning
5. The extension should now appear in your extensions list

## Usage

1. Open any web page or the test page: `test.html` (in this folder)
2. **IMPORTANT**: Click anywhere on the page first (required for browser security)
3. Try pressing `Ctrl+W` - you should see a confirmation dialog
4. Try closing the tab with the X button - you should see another confirmation
5. Check the browser console (F12) for debug messages

## Configuration

1. Click the extension icon in your browser toolbar
2. Toggle protection on/off
3. Enable/disable confirmation dialogs
4. The status indicator will show if protection is active

## What's Fixed

### Major Improvements:

- **User Interaction Detection**: Extension now waits for user interaction before activating (browser requirement)
- **Multiple Protection Layers**:
  - `beforeunload` event (primary protection)
  - Keyboard event interception for `Ctrl+W`
  - `window.close()` override
- **Visual Feedback**: Shows a brief indicator when protection is active
- **Better Error Handling**: Proper error messages and debugging
- **Enhanced Compatibility**: Works on all websites and handles edge cases

### Technical Details:

- Uses `beforeunload` event which is the most reliable method
- Prevents other scripts from disabling the protection
- Tracks user interaction to comply with browser security policies
- Provides comprehensive logging for debugging

## Troubleshooting

If the extension doesn't work:

1. **Reload the extension** in `chrome://extensions/`
2. **Check console** for error messages (F12)
3. **Ensure user interaction** - click on the page first
4. **Verify permissions** - extension should have "storage" and "activeTab"
5. **Test on different websites** - some sites may interfere

The extension should now work reliably!
