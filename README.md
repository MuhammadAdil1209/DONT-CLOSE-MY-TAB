# DON'T CLOSE MY TAB Extension - Installation & Testing Guide

## üöÄ How to Install and Test

### Step 1: Install the Extension

1. Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions/`
2. Enable "Developer mode" (toggle in top-right corner)
3. Click "Load unpacked"
4. Select this folder: `c:\Users\BIT\Documents\github\DONT-CLOSE-MY-TAB`
5. The extension should now appear in your extensions list

### Step 2: Test the Extension

1. Open the test page: `test.html` (in this folder)
2. **IMPORTANT**: Click anywhere on the page first (required for browser security)
3. Try pressing `Ctrl+W` - you should see a confirmation dialog
4. Try closing the tab with the X button - you should see another confirmation
5. Check the browser console (F12) for debug messages

### Step 3: Configure Settings

2. Toggle protection on/off
3. Enable/disable confirmation dialogs
4. The status indicator will show if protection is active

## üîß What's Fixed

### Major Improvements:

- **User Interaction Detection**: Extension now waits for user interaction before activating (browser requirement)
- **Multiple Protection Layers**:
  - `beforeunload` event (primary protection)
  - Keyboard event interception for `Ctrl+W`
  - `window.close()` override
- **Visual Feedback**: Shows a brief indicator when protection is active
- **Better Error Handling**: Proper error messages and debugging
- **Enhanced Compatibility**: Works on all websites and handles edge cases

### Technical Details:

- Uses `beforeunload` event which is the most reliable method
- Prevents other scripts from disabling the protection
- Tracks user interaction to comply with browser security policies
- Provides comprehensive logging for debugging

## üß™ Testing Scenarios

1. **Basic Test**: Press `Ctrl+W` after clicking on the page
2. **Tab Close**: Click the X button on the tab
3. **Window Close**: Use the test button on the test page
4. **Settings**: Toggle extension on/off via popup
5. **Console**: Check for "DON'T CLOSE MY TAB:" messages in F12 console

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- **User interaction required**: You must click/interact with the page first
- **Browser limitations**: Some browser shortcuts cannot be completely blocked
- **Website compatibility**: Works on all regular websites (not on chrome:// pages)
- **Confirmation dialogs**: Uses browser's built-in confirmation for security

## üêõ Troubleshooting

If the extension doesn't work:

1. **Reload the extension** in `chrome://extensions/`
2. **Check console** for error messages (F12)
3. **Ensure user interaction** - click on the page first
4. **Verify permissions** - extension should have "storage" and "activeTab"
5. **Test on different websites** - some sites may interfere

The extension should now work reliably! üéâ
